# Domain of the Irate Deity
hi fri dev work pls

## Project Setup
On Github clone the repo to your desired location -> `<your path>/IrateDeity`

***Make sure you are using Unity Editor version 2022.3.37f1***


In UnityHub, create a new Project called "IrateDeity". Select "Universal 2D" project and place within the Github repo you cloned. ->  `<your path>/IrateDeity/IrateDeity`. 

In the project editor, drag the correct "Scene" file into the hierarchy to get all the premade scenes brought up into. 

## Coding Practices

Make sure to clean up the files for every PR made. Each type of file should be stored in the proper directory (Scenes, Prefabs, Sprites).

```
Assets
|- Scenes
|- Prefabs
|   |- Weapons
|   |- Enemies
|   |- Terrain
|   |- Misc
|- Sprites
    |- Enemies
    |- Characters
    |- Backgrounds
```
